Next.js PWA Project Status and Todo List
Current State Overview
The project is a Next.js Progressive Web Application with a comprehensive feature set including chat interface, storage management, knowledge base, and settings with AI model management. Let's assess the current state and outline what needs to be done before deployment.

‚úÖ Completed Features
UI Framework and Navigation

Complete UI component library based on shadcn/ui
Navigation sidebar with all main sections
Responsive layouts
Theme System

Dark/light theme implementation with system preference detection
Theme persistence in localStorage
Smooth transitions between themes
GraphQL Schema Architecture

Comprehensive type definitions for all domains
Federation structure for subgraphs
Basic resolver structure
Client Infrastructure

Apollo client setup for primary GraphQL operations
URQL client as alternative with specialized exchanges
Service worker integration framework for offline capabilities
Storage UI

File browser interface
Storage usage visualization
File upload interface
Knowledge Base UI

Knowledge item listing and filtering
Category-based organization
Creation and editing forms
Settings Management

Theme and appearance customization
AI model configuration interfaces
Storage and system settings
State Management

Zustand stores for various domains
Persistence layer for offline data
üöß Work in Progress
GraphQL Backend Implementation

Schema defined but resolvers need completion
Subgraph services structure exists but needs implementation
Federation gateway needs complete deployment configuration
Authentication System

Token structure exists but lacks complete auth flow
Need login/registration interfaces
Authorization middleware partially implemented
Real-time Features

Subscription framework exists but needs implementation
WebRTC signaling structure ready but needs integration
Real-time data synchronization needs completion
Search Implementation

Orama search foundation exists
Need to complete indexing and search result handling
Advanced search filters not fully implemented
üìã Todo List Before Deployment
Critical Path Items

Next Immediate Steps
Backend Implementation

Focus on implementing the resolvers for each subgraph
Set up a local development database
Create data models and validation
Authentication System

Implement login/registration pages
Set up token management
Test authentication flow
Real Data Integration

Replace mock data with real data sources
Implement proper data fetching hooks
Set up error handling for data operations
Testing Environment

Set up testing framework
Create initial tests for core functionality
Implement CI pipeline
Deployment Readiness Checklist
Before deploying, ensure the following are complete:

Critical security features implemented
Core functionality working end-to-end
Performance metrics meet targets
Testing coverage acceptable
Error handling robust
Documentation up to date
Monitoring and logging in place
Database migration strategy defined
Rollback plan established
User feedback mechanisms implemented
This comprehensive list should guide the development team toward a production-ready application. The current architecture shows good planning and structure, but significant implementation work remains before the application is ready for deployment.√è
